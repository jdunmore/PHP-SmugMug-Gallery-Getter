PHP-SmugMug-Gallery-Getter
==========================

Uses a PHP script to grab the contents of a smugmug RSS feed to a local directory

Simply just put your smugmug RSS url in where it says URL. Will change this in future to become a command line arg

Will only download files that are not in the current directory (@todo will make this directory an arg too).
The reason behind only download once is so that it can be run as sync job (I find it very helpful to update a local dir that i use for a screen saver)

This is only a quick script to do a quick and dirty job, will make it better in the future.
